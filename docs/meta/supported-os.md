## Windows Server Support
While our general stance is that we do not offer Windows Server support for business environments, we understand that each system has its own unique purpose. If a Windows Server system requires support for a business, we recommend seeking assistance from the IT department or designated support team. However, we can provide support for those utilizing Windows Server in a home lab environment if it is within reason and not an end-of-life (EOL) version (such as Windows Server 2008 R2 and earlier at the time of writing). We suggest seeking advice from communities such as r/sysadmin and r/homelab for more specific topics.
