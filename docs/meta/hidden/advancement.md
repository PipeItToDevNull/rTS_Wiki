# Processes for Advancement
This is a guide on how /r/TechSupport will guide its internal progression and promotion of roles on the Discord server.

## Helper
A user should be active in at least 1 support channel for a minimum of 3 individual days prior to being made **Helper** to ensure they intend to stay present in the community.

Approval from other staff members can be sought, but is not required. Removal of this role can be done with at least 1 other moderator agreeing unless under extreme circumstances such as abuse or harassment.

[Helper Guidelines](/docs/meta/helpers)

## Trusted
**Trusted** users should be **Helper** for at least a month prior to being considered for advancement.

To grant **Trusted**, **Moderators** will have to ask and have at least 40% of 'available' **Moderators**, but no less then 4 **Moderators** to agree on the role promotion. Once agreed you will have to DM/speak with the user and make sure they adhere and understand our rules and ethics.

## Moderator
**Moderator** users should be **Trusted** for at least a month prior to being considered for advancement.

Granting the **Moderator** role should be discussed by all members of the **Moderator** role and have a general consensus (65%) of approval at time of message. The role can not be given immediately and have a 48h cool down period after discussion to allow others to weigh in on the decision.

A final warning message to all **Moderators** must be given before granting the role.

Before the role is granted, after approval, a moderator must DM the user and talk to them about our standards for **Moderator** and what is expected from them.

Removal of **Moderator** can be done with approval of 40% or no less then 5 other **Moderators** if they have been a moderator for less then 2 months. At least 90% of **Moderators** or general consensus must be agreed any any longer time served.
