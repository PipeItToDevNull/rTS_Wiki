# Regular

For the purposes of this section, "Moderator" means "Trusted" OR "Moderator", unless otherwise stated. <br>
There is currently no limit to the number of regulars.

### Becoming regular
The bare minimum requirements for becoming a regular are: <br>
* Active in a support channel on at least three different days <br>
* Be a server member for at least 72 hours before advancement <br>

There is no required voting process to advance someone to regular; however, an informal vote may be sought if desired. If a vote is sought, as long as at least one other moderator approves, the vote is successful. There is no minimum time after a vote for regular.

All moderators get a say in pushing people to Regular. If the individual who pushes for the promotion doesn't have the ability to promote them, they may ping individuals and ask for a promotion. <br>
The role should only be assigned when the person is active and on the server.

After the assignment, the new regular shall be pinged in the regulars channel and informed of their new role by the moderator responsible for assigning the role. They are the sole moderator who decides what information is relevant immediately, a ping storm doesn't need to occur as everyone shares what they think is needed.

An interest form is not a requirement for becoming a regular.

### Removing regulars
Removing a regular should have a formal vote conducted unless there are extreme circumstances, such as abuse or harassment. Extreme circumstances will be left up to the initiating moderator to decide. <br>
In the event of extreme circumstances, the initiating moderator must immediately ban the offender. <br>
If a regular is removed for extreme circumstances, a formal vote is required to bring them back.

This vote shall only run for 24 hours instead of the regular 48 hours

For this vote, the requirements for passing are: <br>
* At least 1 moderator, who is not the initiating moderator, votes yes **AND** <br>
* Less than 50% of all moderators vote no

In this vote, the initiating moderator can choose one of two cases: <br>
1) They select what action should happen when the vote finishes (Demote, remove all roles, kick, ban, etc) <br>
2) They have people vote on what action should happen

If the second case is chosen, a vote for any action is considered a vote for yes. Unless there is a tie, if the yes vote passes, the plurality vote for action is selected. If there is a tie, everyone who voted for the other option(s) is asked to re-evaluate and given 24 hours to make a new decision. If no conclusive decision is made after that, the initiating moderators choice is picked.

Unless there is an outstanding issue, action can happen immediately after voting formally concludes. Demotion must occur within 7 days of the vote concluding or a new vote must be run.

# Helper

For the purposes of this section, "Moderator" means "Trusted" OR "Moderator", unless otherwise stated. <br>
There is currently no limit to the number of helpers.

### Becoming helper <br>
The bare minimum requirements for becoming a helper are: <br>
* Have been a regular for at least 15 consecutive days

This vote shall only run for 24 hours instead of the regular 48 hours

There is no waiting period after the voting has concluded.

Promotion must occur within 7 days of the vote concluding or a new vote must be run.

Unless the initiating moderator cannot or is unavailable, it is exclusively their responsibility to assign the role. Delegation must occur if the initiating moderator cannot or will not. <br>
The role should only be assigned when the person is active and on the server.

After the assignment, the new helper shall be pinged in the helper channel and informed of their new role by the moderator responsible for assigning the role. They are the sole moderator who decides what information is relevant immediately, a ping storm doesn't need to occur as everyone shares what they think is needed.

### Removing helpers
The removal of helper requires a vote prior to action. 

If desired by the initiating moderator, this vote may be restricted to moderators only instead of trusted and moderators. <br>
If this is exercised, a compelling reason must be stated. The vote will be invalidated without reason, or with poor reason.

For this vote, the requirements for passing are:
* Agreement by at least 50% of all moderators **OR**
* Agreement by at least 50%, but no less than 4, of all voting moderators **OR**
* A complete agreement by 4 different moderators with no opposed

In this vote, the initiating moderator can choose one of two cases: <br>
1) They select what action should happen when the vote finishes (Demote, remove all roles, kick, ban, etc) <br>
2) They have people vote on what action should happen

If the second case is chosen, a vote for any action is considered a vote for yes. Unless there is a tie, if the yes vote passes, the plurality vote for action is selected. If there is a tie, everyone who voted for the other option(s) is asked to re-evaluate and given 24 hours to make a new decision. If no conclusive decision is made after that, the initiating moderators choice is picked.

Unless there is an outstanding issue, action can happen immediately after voting formally concludes. Demotion must occur within 7 days of the vote concluding or a new vote must be run.

The role should only be assigned when the person is active and on the server, even if that means waiting longer than 24 hours.

After the assignment, the new trusted shall be pinged in the trusted channel and informed of their new role by the moderator responsible for assigning the role. They are the sole moderator who decides what information is relevant immediately, a ping storm doesn't need to occur as everyone shares what they think is needed.

### Removing trusted
The removal of trusted requires a vote prior to action.  <br>
The conditions under which a vote can pass vary based on the length of time a person has been trusted. The requirements are set on the day the vote is started.

If no conclusive decision is made after that, the initiating moderators choice is picked.

Unless there is an outstanding issue, action can happen immediately after voting formally concludes. Demotion must occur within 7 days of the vote concluding or a new vote must be run.

# Moderator

### Becoming moderator
The bare minimum requirements for becoming moderator are:
* Have been trusted for at least 30 consecutive days
* Be at least 18 years of age
* There must currently be 14 or less moderators, **OR** plans in place to remove 1 moderator prior to promotion.

Voting can occur prior to these requirements being met, but the role cannot be given until the requirements are met.

A vote must be conducted prior to advancement. <br>
For this vote, the requirements for passing are:
* Agreement by at least 65% of all moderators **OR**
* Agreement by at least 65%, but no less than 6, of all voting moderators

If none of these are met when the vote ends, the vote fails. In the event of a failed vote, a mandatory waiting period of 1 week is required before another vote for this person is attempted.

If the vote is successful, a mandatory waiting period of 48 hours shall be held. Promotion must occur within 7 days of the vote concluding or a new vote must be run.

Unless the initiating moderator cannot or is unavailable, it is exclusively their responsibility to assign the role. Delegation must occur if the initiating moderator cannot or will not. <br>

After the assignment, the new moderator shall be pinged in the moderator channel and informed of their new role by the moderator responsible for assigning the role. They are the sole moderator who decides what information is relevant immediately, a ping storm doesn't need to occur as everyone shares what they think is needed.


### Removing moderators
The removal of moderator requires a vote prior to action. <br>
The conditions under which a vote can pass vary based on length of time a person has been moderator. The requirements are set on the day the vote is started.

If this person is an active moderator, and has been moderator for less than 2 months, these are the requirements for passing:
* Agreement by at least 40% of all moderators **OR**
* Agreement by at least 40%, but no less than 4, of all voting moderators

If this person is an active moderator and has been a moderator for at least 2 months, these are the requirements for passing:
* Agreement by at least 90% of all moderators **OR**
* Agreement by at least 90%, but no less than 8, of all voting moderators

In this vote, the initiating moderator can choose one of two cases: <br>
1) They select what action should happen when the vote finishes (Demote, remove all roles, kick, ban, etc)
2) They have people vote on what action should happen

If the second case is chosen, a vote for any action is considered a vote for yes. Unless there is a tie, if the yes vote passes, the plurality vote for action is selected. If there is a tie, everyone who voted for the other option(s) is asked to re-evaluate and given 24 hours to make a new decision. If no conclusive decision is made after that, the initiating moderators choice is picked.

Unless there is an outstanding issue, action can happen immediately after voting formally concludes. Demotion must occur within 7 days of the vote concluding or a new vote must be run.

# General voting procedures
If a vote is conducted, the initiating moderator is responsible for:
* Initially reacting to the vote message
* Pinging all moderators (not @here/everyone)

After a vote starts, the vote will run for exactly 48 hours. After that, anyone who has not cast a vote will be considered "inactive" for the purposes of that vote only. No formal conclusion can be drawn or actions can be done until after the vote ends.
At this point, the vote will become stale. If this topic is to arise again, the old vote cannot be used, and a new vote must be started. No prior votes will count in this new vote.

Rounding is not allowed in voting. The vote either passes or doesn't. Being close means it fails.

### Default passing cases
In a vote not classified above, the following will be the passing case:
* Agreement by at least 50% of all moderators **OR**
* Agreement by at least 50%, but no less than 6, of all voting moderators

### Voting to remove inactive individuals
If the person being removed is inactive on the server, a formal vote is not required. 

An initiating moderator may say "these people are inactive", list names AND highest staff role, and ping the moderator role for approval. <br>
If after 12 hours, there are no outstanding objections, all staff roles shall be removed from the individual. <br>
If any single moderator has an objection, that person can still be removed but must be considered active for the purposes of removal. This status is temporary and lasts 14 days. <br>
Any moderators may require a review by another moderator. In this case, removal of roles must be halted until that moderator gets a chance to review, regardless of if it has been 12 hours or not.

Inactive demotion must happen within 24 hours of approval, or new approval must be sought.

While not required, notifying people of pending removal and/or post removal inactive can be done. It is the initiating moderators choice.

The following definition of inactive shall be followed:
* Not active in a support channel for at least 90 days.
* Not active in any channels for at least 60 days. This activity must be more than saying hi occasionally. This definition is based on the initiating moderators observations.
* Not using moderation perms, if applicable, for at least 30 days.

### What happens in a failed vote
If a vote fails for any reason, no action is taken. <br>
A mandatory waiting period of 1 week is imposed before this topic is required before another vote is held. <br>
The previous initiating moderator cannot be the initiator for a repeat vote.

# Edge cases

### What happens if a vote is held but doesn't comply with these rules
If a vote is conducted and it is determined that the rules stated here are not followed, the vote is immediately cancelled if no action is taken. <br>
If action has already been taken, a vote MAY occur to undo the actions on the basis of an invalid vote. This vote is not required to take place.

In the event a vote like that takes place, the following are the requirements for passing:
* Agreement by at least 50% of all moderators **OR**
* Agreement by at least 50%, but no less than 5, of all voting moderators **OR**
* Agreement by at least 40% of all moderators who voted in the invalid vote.

Regardless of where the initial vote took place, a reversal of an invalid vote shall be restricted to moderators only.

In the event the voting is cancelled, there is no mandatory waiting period before bringing up this topic again. Once the issue causing the vote to be invalid is resolved, the vote can start over.

### Invalidating votes
Any formal vote is rejected if the following conditions are met, regardless of if the vote would have passed based on individual requirements:
* At least 70% of all moderators have voted no **OR**
* There are 4 or fewer voting moderators

### What happens if the initiating moderator leaves during the vote
If the initiating moderator leaves prior to the vote being concluded, it is the responsibility of anyone with the "super op" role to claim the initiating role, or assign someone else to be the initiator for the purposes of this vote

### What happens during a tie
If a perfect tie occurs, a run off election between the top two choices must occur. This election lasts for 24 hours, and everyone who didn't vote for the top two options should be notified they need to make a new selection. <br>
People who did not vote initially are welcome to vote at this stage.

If after that runoff, there is still a perfect tie, the initiating moderators choice is the winner. <br>
In the event the initiating moderator did not vote, it is the responsibility of anyone with the "super op" role to declare the winner, or to declare the vote "stale" and take no action.

### People up for promotion leaving during the vote
If the person up for promotion leaves during the vote, the vote is over in a "failed" state. <br>
Should they come back, a new vote must be started.

### People leaving on their own and asking for roles back
In the event an individual leaves on their own and asks for roles back, the following roles may be granted without a vote:

The following roles cannot be granted back immediately, and must have a waiting period of 30 days
"super op"

The following roles must be granted back only with a passing formal vote: <br>
"Moderator+" and "Moderator" <br>
"Trusted" **if** "Trusted" was previously the highest-ranking staff role

The passing rate for this vote shall be the default.

The following roles must be granted back only with a passing informal vote: <br>
"Trusted" **if** "Trusted" was NOT previously the hightest ranking staff role <br>
"Regular" **AND** "Helper" **if** "Helper" **OR** "Regular" was previously the highest-ranking staff role

The following roles may be granted back without any voting: <br>
"Regular" **AND** "Helper" **if** "Helper" was lower than the previously highest-ranking staff role

### People deciding they don't want the promotion
If someone gets promoted and says they do not want it, that must be listened to and the promotion is to be immediately reversed without a vote. <br>
This will not prohibit that person from being up for promotion again in the future, but a mandatory waiting period of 30 days must occur before any promotion votes for this person occurs again.

### Promoting people again who have lost their roles
Unless the individual was demoted for inactivity, a formal vote is required to take place, even if it wouldn't be ordinarly required. <br>
The passing line for this vote shall be the same as promotion to moderator, which is as following:
* Agreement by at least 65% of all moderators **OR**
* Agreement by at least 65%, but no less than 6, of all voting moderators

### Extreme harassment and threats to the community
In the event that a current member of staff with any role becomes an extreme problem, a flash vote can occur to resolve the issues that may arise. <br>
This section doesn't apply to anyone with the highest-ranking staff role of "Regular". In that case, a moderator may decide extreme circumstances and ban the individual if they deem it needed. <br>
This vote will last 1 hour or less, and action will be taken immediately. <br>
The only action allowed in these flash votes is to immediately ban. <br>
The initiating moderator may chose to issue a 1 hour timeout on the person subject to this vote if they think it is needed.

The passing requirements are as follows:
* Agreement by at least 5 of all moderators **AND**
* No more than 1 person who thinks this is un-needed and a slower removal process is acceptable.

Once all 3 of these requirements are met, action can be taken immediately and the vote is over. <br>
In the event this vote fails, either by not meeting passing requirements in 1 hour, or by having 2 or more people disagree, a flash vote cannot be conducted again on this person for 48 hours.
