# Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU)
Display Driver Uninstaller is a program that can fully wipe display/audio drivers, to troubleshoot various issues.

> DDU does not erase any personal files. It only wipes the selected driver(s), and any associated info, such as display color profiles, settings, etc

## Installing DDU

1. [Download DDU](https://www.guru3d.com/files-get/display-driver-uninstaller-download,19.html) and _extract_ the .zip:
