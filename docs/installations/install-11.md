# Part 1: Creating USB Installer

1. Create a bootable USB flash drive using the [Media Creation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11) from Microsoft. This will also wipe any data stored on the USB flash drive.

   > Save MCT to Desktop or Downloads folder. MCT must be saved and run from outside the USB flash drive. Just moving an ISO file to the USB flash drive will not make it bootable.

2. Run MCT by double clicking it. You will be greeted with windows Terms Of Service, after reading it, press Accept.

# Part 2: Installing Windows 11

   > Please make sure to disable CSM, enable Secure Boot, enable TPM and set SATA mode to AHCI if your drive is using SATA prior to installation of Windows 11

   > It is best to disconnect all storage disks except from the main (C Drive) disk from the computer before installing Windows 11. Not doing so can accidentally result in the installer choosing the wrong disk as the boot drive and putting actual windows on another drive.

1. Boot into your USB that has the Windows 11 Media on it. 
	
	* *You can do this by entering your systems' BIOS and change the BIOS boot order to have USB media as the first priority (this can usually be found under the boot tab), or simply look for the words "boot menu" when you see your BIOS boot screen, press the corresponding function key and choose the USB flash drive to boot from it.*
    
2. Follow the steps on screen to install Windows 11. 
 
3. Click `Install now`

4. Continue on until you hit the license key screen. Here you can either enter your license code, or if Windows has been installed to this computer before, click on the `I don't have a product key` link.

6. Click on each partition of the target drive and select delete (if you don't know the target drive, go back and unplug the drives you don't want to install windows on). ***Each means ALL*** But do you mean ALL? ***Yes, All***. Once all the partitions are gone you will be left with unallocated space. At this point click `Next`.

        Ensure that you only have drive 0 partitions in this window before deleting, otherwise this means you didnt disconnect other drives as noted in step 8.
