# How to Update BIOS

Sometimes the CPU is not supported and therefore we will need to update BIOS. Or perhaps a certain OS is not supported for a BIOS version (Windows 11 for example, it can be picky). Or a driver is not supported, etc.

In these cases, we will need to update the BIOS to ensure things work properly.

### What is BIOS?

BIOS stands for Basic Input Output System. It is the firmware of the motherboard that allows the control of inputs and outputs of the system, and is necessary to boot into any OS. It provides runtime services for operating systems and programs to perform hardware initialization during the boot process, so it is a necessary feature in any and all PCs.

Different BIOS versions support different CPUs, so if you are doing a CPU upgrade, a BIOS update may be necessary to ensure the CPU will work properly. Without it, the PC will not even boot.

> ! Note: Not all CPUs need a BIOS update. Please check what BIOS version you are running, and what version is supported by the CPU, before doing the upgrade to ensure no problems will occur down the line. More information on this will be discussed below.
