# Tech Scams
{: .no_toc}

{% include toc.md %}

Due to recent advancements in communication over the net, the modern internet is ripe with targets for scammers and shady characters trying to exploit others for their personal benefit, whether that is via scamming you out of your accounts, emails, or stealing your bank credentials and cratering your personal accounts. This document is to make you aware of common forms of scams and what precautions you should take before trusting another individual with personal details or accounts.

This document is to provided you with details on the methods people use to take advantage of the unknowing and what they use to get people to trust them. This document will go into some of the forms people use to gain the "trust" of people, and if you already have fell victim to their scam, it will also discuss what you can do to hopefully recuperate your compromised information and accounts.

## The Tech-Support scam

{: .warning .warning-icon }
> Beware of direct messages from "admins" or "tech-support" for platforms like Discord or Steam, typically offering to fix account issues. These are scams designed to extract sensitive data or jeopardize your account. Genuine services seldom send such messages and official communication, even from Discord staff, doesn't occur on Discord but through a proper ticket system via emails. Any "official" support offered on Discord is fraudulent.

It’s not uncommon to encounter instances where individuals posing as “administrators” or “technical support” representatives for various online services, such as Discord, Steam, and others, will initiate a direct message (DM) conversation with you. The subject of these messages can vary widely, but a common example might be the “resolution of an account issue," such as the common "I accidentally mass reported your account!" scam.

These unsolicited messages may appear legitimate at first glance, with the sender often mimicking the language and tone of a genuine support representative. However, it’s important to note that these messages are, in fact, a form of scam. The individuals behind them are not associated with the service they claim to represent, and their ultimate goal is to deceive you into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that compromise your account’s security.

One common tactic these scammers employ is to ask you to “verify” your account or “sign in” to resolve the supposed issue. This is a massive red flag. Legitimate services will never ask you to provide your login credentials in a direct message. Another scam to be aware of involves password reset requests. Scammers may claim to "verify yourself" with a code, which often is the password reset code or link, with the aim of hijacking your account. Another particularly insidious method involves the use of QR codes. The scammer may ask you to sign in using a QR code, which can lead to your account being compromised. This is a major concern and should be avoided at all costs.

{: .info .info-icon }
> Always remember that **legitimate services typically have established channels for addressing account issues** and rarely, if ever, initiate unsolicited direct messages for such matters. If you receive such a message, it’s best to ignore it and report it to the appropriate authorities within the platform. Stay vigilant and protect your digital presence. Remember, your account security is paramount, and you should never feel pressured into taking actions that could potentially compromise it.

### Example of a Tech-Support scam

</summary>

The scammer approaches a user claiming they "accidentally" reported them because they themselves were "scammed" by a scammer who "claimed" to be you. This garners sympathy from the potential victim, lowering their guard. Often to further sell the scam, they will show "proof" of reporting "your account" by making a fake account to your likeness:

They then lead you to their "tech support" agent that they were working with to help "resolve" the situation:

The "support" agent may look legitimate, but remember that no official support agent for a service will be utilizing discord to resolve issues, even official discord staff.

## Request from a Compromised Friend’s account

{: .warning .warning-icon }
> Exercise caution when dealing with messages from anyone, even those you consider friends, that request you to "register" or "log in" to assist them with a certain task. Be wary as well of requests to download items to aid in "testing" a game or application, particularly if the sender is not known for engaging in development work. This caution should extend to downloading files such as PDFs, PNGs, or any other type of file under the pretext of checking if it "appears correct", as they can contain viruses. Remember, it's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your digital security.

Scams can sometimes appear to originate from individuals within your personal network or acquaintances (such as friends on different platforms). However, it’s crucial to be aware that the person contacting you may not be your friend but rather a scammer who has gained access to your friend’s account. 

They may approach you with a seemingly innocuous request, such as participating in a competition to enhance their probability of success. The sign-in process for such activities may offer multiple methods, including email, Steam, Discord, and others. Upon registration, your account may be compromised due to the unauthorized acquisition of your credentials.

Another variant of this scam involves requests to download and “test” a program, or to review an image or PDF to verify its appearance/contents. The request to test a program should immediately raise suspicions, particularly if the individual in question has not previously engaged in any recognizable development activities. Developers typically exhibit signs of programming knowledge and often share their projects.

As for images or PDFs, they can sometimes conceal malicious code that executes upon opening. Receiving an unsolicited PDF for review should also be viewed with suspicion.

It’s crucial not to place unwarranted trust in friends when it comes to such requests. Always seek additional information regarding the file in question and attempt to verify their identity through alternative communication channels, such as WhatsApp, Discord, or Steam, if possible.

### Example of a compromized account scam

Regrettably, I fell victim to such a scam, in which this particular example will detail.

Amidst a gaming session, I received a personal message on Steam from a friend. They requested my assistance in boosting their team’s standing in a competition by signing in with my Steam account. Distracted by the game, I didn’t scrutinize the chat or probe further. Unwittingly, I signed in using the QR code sign in method Steam offers, overlooking the fact that it originated from a location outside my usual area of residence.

The following day, while I was occupied at work, the scammer gained access to my Steam account. Without my knowledge, they began sending messages to my friends, encouraging them to participate in their “competition” to aid my alleged “team’s victory”.

The following screenshots detail one such interaction of the scammers with one of my friends.

![comp_friend_steam_01.JPG](/assets/tech-scams/comp_friend_steam_01.JPG)

![comp_friend_steam_02.JPG](/assets/tech-scams/comp_friend_steam_02.JPG)

Unaware of the unfolding situation, I continued with my professional responsibilities at my job. Miraculously, another friend from Steam reached out to me on Discord, a platform I predominantly use for communication, as I rarely resorted to Steam chats. They initiated a casual conversation, oblivious to the fact that I was engaged at work. The subsequent screenshot captures our interaction and my abrupt realization that my Steam account had been compromised.

![comp_friend_steam_discord.JPG](/assets/tech-scams/comp_friend_discord.JPG)

Upon this revelation, I promptly reviewed all my friends’ chats, alerting them about the breach in my account’s security. I cautioned them against clicking any links and advised those who had already done so to immediately change their passwords to prevent their accounts from being compromised

![comp_friend_steam_03.JPG](/assets/tech-scams/comp_friend_steam_03.JPG)

Ultimately, I was able to regain control of my accounts, terminate all other Steam sessions, and prevent the scammer from further accessing my friends list, out of sheer luck. However, it’s important to acknowledge that this incident was the result of several oversights on my part. Specifically, I failed to:
- Recognize the site I was directed to and the counterfeit Steam login page on the website.
- Heed the sign-in warning indicating that I was logging in from a device located outside my usual area of residence.
- Request a follow-up or pay closer attention to the messages I sent or logins from other devices.

{: .info .info-icon }
> It’s also noteworthy that the friend whom the scammer attempted to defraud is widely knowledgeable about cybersecurity and familiar with scams of this nature. Yet, they unsuspectingly accepted the scammer’s claims because they came from a trusted friend (i.e., me). This serves as a reminder that even professionals can fall prey to such scams, underscoring the need for heightened vigilance.

## Email scams/Text scams

Email and text scams are prevalent forms of fraudulent activities. These scams, which are becoming increasingly sophisticated, may target various accounts, including your email, bank, or even involve you in a multi-level marketing scheme for their benefit. The complexity of these scams is escalating, making it increasingly challenging to distinguish between authentic and fraudulent emails.

{: .warning .warning-icon }
> When dealing with suspicious emails, it’s imperative to exercise caution. Always scrutinize the sender’s email address; official communications will originate from official email accounts, not arbitrary third-party emails. Double-check the links, spelling, format of the email, images, and logos. Refrain from clicking on any links within these emails or logging in for verification purposes. Additionally, avoid downloading any attachments, such as applications or PDFs, as they may contain malicious software, including viruses, keyloggers, or session hijackers.

Some email scams may impersonate official services, such as Amazon or FedEx. For instance, you may receive an email regarding a package you’ve supposedly ordered, urging you to “further verify” your details. If you have indeed ordered a package, refer back to the package tracker to confirm its status. Any disputes should be directly mentioned in the tracker, allowing you to contact the relevant party and resolve the dispute through the tracker.

At times, an email may attempt to exploit your business account, reaching out with a seemingly innocuous request for advice or similar. For example, in one instance, supposedly my own CEO reached out to ask for a package of some sort. Thanks to the email it was sent by, and the fact that I have other means of reaching out to my CEO, I was able to immediately identify this as a scam email. By reconfirming with the CEO using official means of communication (in this case, MS Teams), I was able to verify that this was indeed a scam email.

Other email scams may present unsolicited job or interview offers, aiming to extract your personal information with the intent to bypass account security measures or potentially blackmail you later. It’s advisable not to respond to these either.

Please note that these are merely examples. Email scams are becoming increasingly elaborate, and the most effective way to avoid them is to refrain from interacting with them in the first place and promptly discard them. 

For more information regarding how to recognize a scam email, as well as what kinds of scam emails there are and their examples, please refer to this wiki article here: [Email scams](/docs/safety-security/email-scams).

## Precautions to take

In order to safeguard oneself from potential scams, it is prudent to adopt preventative measures rather than dealing with the aftermath. The subsequent guidelines provide a general approach to handling unsolicited communications or potential scam messages.

### Avoiding Downloads
It is crucial to exercise caution when downloading files from the internet. Even seemingly harmless file types such as PNGs, JPGs, PDFs, etc., can harbor malicious scripts or viruses. These harmful elements can be triggered automatically upon download, potentially compromising your account or operating system. Therefore, it is always advisable to thoroughly verify the source and content of any download. In case an unverified file has been downloaded, it is recommended to reinstall the operating system. This ensures the complete eradication of any potentially harmful elements, providing a clean slate for your system’s security.

### Verifying Website Links
When you receive a link, especially in an unsolicited message, it’s important not to click on it impulsively. Instead, take a moment to inquire about its content and purpose. This precaution can help you avoid landing on a fraudulent page designed to mimic a legitimate website. If you have any doubts about the authenticity of a site, take the time to cross-verify the link with the official site. This step can help confirm the legitimacy of the site and protect you from potential phishing attempts.

### Updating Browser and Antivirus Software
Keeping your operating system and web browser updated is a key aspect of maintaining system security. Software updates often include patches for known vulnerabilities, which can significantly reduce the risk of a successful cyber attack. An updated system is less susceptible to malicious code execution, providing a safer environment for your online activities.

### Confirming Sign-In Details
When signing into sites, it’s important to pay close attention to the details of the sign-in link. Make sure that the link directs you to the official login page of the respective site. Be wary of using QR codes for signing in, as they can easily obscure important details such as the sign-in destination. Despite their convenience, the use of QR codes can increase the risk of overlooking suspicious elements, potentially leading to security breaches.

### Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and utilizing password managers
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a highly recommended security measure that adds an extra layer of protection to your online accounts. By requiring verification from another device during sign-in, MFA significantly increases the difficulty for unauthorized users to gain access to your accounts. More details of MFA can be found in our [Multi-Factor Authentication wiki article](/docs/safety-security/mfa). Popular apps of MFA include, but are not limited to:
- [Steamguard](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/06B0-26E6-2CF8-254C) (For Steam only)
- [Discord MFA](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Multi-Factor-Authentication) (For Discord only)
- [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS) (General MFA application)
- [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-mfa-multi-factor-authentication) (General MFA application)

However, it's important to note that the use of QR codes for sign-in can potentially undermine the effectiveness of MFA. The convenience of QR codes can lead to oversights, potentially allowing malicious actors to bypass the additional security provided by MFA. 

In addition to MFA, the use of password managers, such as Bitwarden, can further enhance your online security. Password managers help you create, store, and manage strong, unique passwords for all your accounts, reducing the risk of password-related breaches. By combining the use of MFA and a reliable password manager, you can significantly bolster the security of your online accounts. To learn more about password managers, please refer to our [Password Managers wiki article](/docs/safety-security/pw-managers).

### Utilizing different email accounts
When interacting with websites of uncertain credibility, it’s highly recommended to use an alternative email address. This strategy not only helps to protect your primary email account but also allows you to organize your online activities more effectively. For instance, you might have a dedicated email address for work-related matters, another for gaming, a personal email for communication with friends and family, and an alternative email for potentially risky interactions (such as signing up for shady sites).

This level of separation can significantly enhance your online security and privacy. It’s also crucial to be mindful of the personal information you share on these platforms. Sharing sensitive details such as your real name or date of birth can expose you to various risks, including identity theft. Therefore, it’s best to provide minimal personal information, especially on sites you’re unsure about.

The most critical aspect to consider is your financial security. It’s imperative to exercise extreme caution when it comes to online transactions. Never use your credit or debit card for any service that you do not fully trust or recognize. If a site or service seems suspicious or too good to be true, it probably is. Always research and verify the legitimacy of a site before providing any financial information.

## What you can do to recover your accounts - TODO

Should in case you fall for a scam and wish to recover your accounts, please follow the following steps to attempt to recover your accounts:

### 1. Terminate sessions on the accounts and resetting passwords

The first step is to reset password and terminate sessions from said accounts. Steps to do so, including how to terminate sessions from common services and applications can be found [here](/docs/safety-security/session-hijack#terminating-sessions-from-services).

Most session hijacks can also be virulent in nature. If you suspect you have been affected by a virus where the attacker is using malware as a vector to access your accounts, you may need to reinstall Windows as a whole to completely remove said virus. More info on how to recover from a virulent attack can be found [here](/docs/safety-security/session-hijack#recommended-actions-in-the-event-of-suspected-session-hijacking).

### 2. Contact the support page of said services

The next step is to contact the support page and request for help to ensure you are safe. Said support contacts for popular/common applications can be found [here](/docs/safety-security/session-hijack#terminating-sessions-from-services).

### 3. Set up 2FA and MFA, start using password managers

Setting up 2FA or MFA is an excellent safety precaution to prevent attackers from logging in to the account. You can review setup of MFA and others [above in the "Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and utilizing password managers" section.](/docs/safety-security/tech-scams#implementing-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-and-utilizing-password-managers)

Using [password managers](/docs/safety-security/pw-managers) is also another extra safety precaution we highly recommend to ensure you use different passwords on different accounts. Using the same password for multiple accounts is bad practice and can lead the attackers to access other accounts on other services.
