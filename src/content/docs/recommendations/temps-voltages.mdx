Watching your temperatures is an important part of managing any machine, especially a gaming rig. There are several tools that can work for this, most should work if you have a relatively up-to-date system.

When reporting your temperatures to people, please use Celsius. It doesn't matter what country you are in, everyone uses Celsius for computers.

### Specify
import UseSpecify from '../../../_includes/embeds/specify.md';

<UseSpecify />

Alternatively, you can use [Get-Specs](/factoids/get-specs) to get similar information.

### HWiNFO
Like Specify it reports lots of important useful information, but it is isolated to hardware. We utilize this for extended logging of voltages, temps, etc. during stress tests.

Please refer to our [HWinfo guide](/guides/hwinfo) if you wish to see how your PC performs during a stress test or during a game (Game Logging).
