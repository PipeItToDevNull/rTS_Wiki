Disk Management is the native graphical utility in Windows for managing disks and partitions. You can open it by pressing Win+R and typing `diskmgmt.msc`.

Disk management can only be run from a installed copy of windows, and has limits on what partitions and disks can be edited. For a more robust solution, consider using [DiskPart](/disks/disk-management/diskpart) or [Gparted](/disks/disk-management/gparted).

## Initialize a new disk
A brand new disk must be initialized before it can be used.

> [!WARNING] Warning
> 
> You should not initialize a disk that already has data on it, your disk has lost data and you need to look into [Data Recovery](/disks/data-recovery/data-recovery)

### Initializing via Popup
1. The first time you open disk management with a brand new disk in a machine you will be presented with a pop up saying "You must initialize a disk before Logical Disk Management can access it."

    ![Must initialize popup](../../../../assets/disk-management/initialize-popup.png)

2. On all modern systems you should choose "GPT (GUID Partition Table). Once you click "Next" you should be able to proceed with [Create a new partition](#create-a-new-partition).

### Manual Initialization
Sometimes you won't get this pop up and instead your disk will appear like below, you will need to manuall initialize this disk.

![Not initialized disk](../../../../assets/disk-management/not-initialized.png)

1. Right click the left panel of the disk and choose "Initialize"

    ![Manual initialization](../../../../assets/disk-management/manual-initialize.png)

2. On all modern systems you should choose "GPT (GUID Partition Table). Once you click "Next" you should be able to proceed with [Create a new partition](#create-a-new-partition).

## Create a new partition
New partitions can only be created from unallocated space.

1. Right click on the unallocated space and choose "New Simple Volume".

    ![NewSimpleVolume-DiskManager.webp](../../../../assets/disk-management/newsimplevolume-diskmanager.webp)

2. By default, the size will be the entire unallocated space. Most of the time, this is fine.

    ![NewVolume-Prompt-1a.webp](../../../../assets/disk-management/newvolume-prompt-1a.webp)

3. You can assign your new partition any drive letter you would like. However, assigning `A` or `B` may cause issues.

    ![NewVolume-Prompt-2a.webp](../../../../assets/disk-management/newvolume-prompt-2a.webp)

4. Set the filesystem to one of three options (there are 3 options, you may have less depending on your drive):

    <DiskFormats />

5. Set the label to what you want.

## Change drive letter
1. Right click on an existing partition and choose "Change Drive Letter and Paths...".
2. If the drive doesn't already have a letter, choose "Add..." on the open dialog. If it already has a letter, "Change...". To remove the drive letter, choose "Remove".

## Change file system
> [!WARNING] Warning
> This is a destructive action, all data on the drive will be deleted.

1. Right click on an existing partition and choose "Format...".

    ![Drive format context menu](../../../../assets/disk-management/drive-format-context.png)

2. Leaving allocation unit size at default and quick format selected will usually work.
3. Choose a filesystem:

    <DiskFormats />

    ![FormatDrive.webp](../../../../assets/disk-management/formatdrive.webp)

4. Click "OK" to format the drive.


## Changing drive label
1. Right click on an existing partition and choose "Properties".

    ![Drive properties context menu](../../../../assets/disk-management/drive-properties-context.png)

2. From this menu, you can change your drive label to anything you would like

    ![Drive properties](../../../../assets/disk-management/drive-properties.png)

## Deleting a partition
1. Right click on an existing partition and choose "Delete Volume..."

    ![Drive delete context menu](../../../../assets/disk-management/drive-delete-volume-context.png)

2. Click "Yes" to delete the partition. You will loose all data on this partition.
